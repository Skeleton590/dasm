# DASM
Or the Dumb Assembly Socket Manager, is a very small HTTP server made in x86 64-bit assembly.

# Building
1. You'll need to have nasm, make, and the GNU Binutils installed.
2. Use git cone to clone the repository.
3. Go to the progect directory and run the make command.

Once you do all that you should have a executable called a.out in the progect directory.

# Running and connecting to the server

Once you have the server built you can run it by doing ./a.out in the progect directory.

After that you can connect to it by going to localhost:4050 in your browser.

Hope you enjoy.

P.S. This is a really sloppy repository right now, I will fix it but i'm kind of in a rush right now.
